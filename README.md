# Wheeler_Project1
This project contains 3 classes including: Project_1 (the main class), Bit_String (the class used to convert an 8-bit binary string to decimal), and Decimal_Int (used to convert decimal values to binary strings). 

The Project_1 class will prompt the user to enter either an 8 if they would like to convert an 8-bit binary string, or a 1 if they would like to convert a decimal number. 

If the user chooses an 8, the main class will call on the Bit_String class and create an object that holds the users input. Then will get the results from all of the representations and print it to the console. 

If the user chooses an 1, the main class will call on the Decimal_Int class and create an object that holds the userd input. This will get the resluts from all of the representations and print it to the console.

If the user enters an invalid number or input, an error message will print to the console and suggest to the user to rerun the program.
